# Book Recommendation Algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project implements a book recommendation algorithm using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The algorithm recommends books that are similar to a given book title based on user ratings from the Book-Crossings dataset.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Under Progress** ðŸš§  
The project is currently under development. The code file with results will be uploaded upon completion.
