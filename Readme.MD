# Book Recommendation Algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project implements a book recommendation algorithm using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The algorithm recommends books that are similar to a given book title based on user ratings from the Book-Crossings dataset.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Under Progress** ðŸš§  
The project is currently under development. The code file with results will be uploaded upon completion.

## Project Structure
- `book_recommendation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the recommendation algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:
